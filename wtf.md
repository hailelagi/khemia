Cantera simulations will always involve one or more phases of matter. Depending on the calcula-
tion being performed, it may be necessary to evaluate thermodynamic properties, but also transport
properties, and/or homogeneous reaction rates for the phase(s) present. In problems with multiple
phases, the properties of the interfaces between phases, and the heterogeneous reaction rates at these
interfaces, may also be required.

## reaction kinetics

# anode (oxidation) e- + ionic species transported through the elctrolyte
reaction:
Anode: 
C + 02 -> C02 + 4e
Cathode: 
O2 + 4e- = 202-
Overall: 
C+ 02 -> CO2

######### 
#  +ve  #

#  -ve  #

# cathode (reduction)
The pyrolized biofuel is fed at the +ve terminal (anode)
air (oxidant) is fed in at -ve terminal (cathode)
